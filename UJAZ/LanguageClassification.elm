## History and classification of languages

#### Origin of language

Leading theories about the origin of the many distinct language families:

1) Onomatopoeia

Humans imitating the sounds of nature gradually form a more complex patterns which eventually develop into language.

2) Physiological theory

The evolution of our brains and speech organs leads to the creation of a "speech capability."

3) Tower of Babel theory

God creates language

#### Classification of languages in Europe

Languages are classified into a hierarchy(tree) of families and groups. Wikipedia has a good article on [The distinct language families](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family).

The most studied language family is that of the Indo-European Languages.  It is theorized that the Indo-European Languages all sprang from one [Proto-Indo-European language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) (PIE).  This language has been reconstructed by way of phonetic transformations and comparative linguistic analysis.  The existence of the PIE was first theorised in 1786 by the British judge William Jones while he was working in India.

Most languages in Europe are of the Indo-European family. There are a few notable exceptions:

 - Basque is a language isolate(it does not belong to any of the larger families)

 - Georgian and several sister languages belong to the Kartvelian language family

 - Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian belong to the Uralic language family

 - Turkish and many smaller languages belong to the Turkic family

 - Hebrew and Maltese are Semetic languages

#### Classifying languages - Overview

Today there are over 30 language families and 5,000 subgroups.  Most languages, 70%, have no written form.  There is no clear way to count the languages.  There is no clear line between dialects and separate languages.

When classifying languages we can look at both extra-linguistic factors and intra-linguistic factors.

- Extra-linguistic factors: Cultural factors
- Intra-linguistic factors: Syntax, phonetics, lexicon

##### Language typology

From an intra-linguistic standpoint we classify languages along a spectrum from _analytic_ to _synthetic_.

Analytic languages or isolating languages do not have inflections using words rather than suffixes to express grammatical details.  Chinese is an analytic language.  English is a relatively analytic language as well.

Synthetic languages are at the other extreme.  There are two types of synthetic languages:

 - _Inflectional languages_ such as Czech have many grammatically inflected word endings.  These languages often feature noun inflection or [case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case) which is a foreign concept to the speaker of an analytic language.

 - _Agglutinating languages_ such as Finish or Turkish

#### Writing systems

The [first evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#Southeast_Asia) of drawing appears about 35 000 BCE.

##### Proto-writing

There are several examples of undeciphered proto-scripts, two of them being:

6600 BCE: At an archaeological site in [Jiahu, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu) [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu_symbols) were found with symbols on them.

5300 BCE: At an archaeological site in present day Romania of the [Vinƒça culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture) [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_signs) were found with symbols on them.

##### Earlies deciphered scripts

The first writing systems appeared independently in Egypt (3200 BCE), China (1200 BCE), and South America(600 BCE).

##### Types of writing

Picture based:
 - Mnemonic glyphs act as reminders to a person who already knows the context of what is written.
 - Pictographic glyphs represent concrete things.  A picture of a bird represents a bird.
 - Ideographic glyphs represent abstract ideas. A picture of a bird might represent flight.

Phonetic writing systems:
 - Syllabic: Each symbol represents a whole syllable.
 - Phonetic alphabetic: Each symbol represents a single phoneme.
 - Non-phonetic alphabetic: Each symbol vaguely represents a sound(English).

####  History of English

- Old English: 450 - 1066

An off branching of old German with Scandinavian influences

There were three tribes in the British Isles: [Angles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles), [Saxons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons), and [Jutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutes).

In 597 B.C.E. [St. Augustine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury) came to the British Isles.  This marks the start of the written record of the English language.

The nominal end of the Old English period is [the Norman Conquest of 1066](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England) when William the Conqueror came to England.

- Middle English: 1200 - 1500

Addition of French and Latin influences

- Early Modern English: 1500 - 1800

Standardization of English spelling with the invention of the printing press.

- Modern English: 1800 - present
