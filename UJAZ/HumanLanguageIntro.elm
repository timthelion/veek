## The peculiarities of human language

### Language Functions

Language has two main functions:

1) Interaction

 The social/emotional function of language

2) Transaction

 The exchange of information

### Human vs Animal

Human language has 6 unique features which distinguish it from the language of Animals.

1) Displacement

 We use language to discuss events, actualities, or objects which are displaced in space and time.  For example, if I say that "the chair is in the next room", I am speaking about an object that is not here and is thus displaced from me.

2) Arbitrariness

The formation of words is arbitrary or abstract.  There are many onomatopoeic words such as 'moo', 'bang', and 'blub'.  Most words, however, are not onomatopoeic.  They have an entirely arbitrary form.  For example, what relationship do the letters/sounds 't', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'e' have to the piece of furniture upon which my computer now rests?

3) Productivity

New words can be created to refer to new concepts, thus providing us with an unlimited capacity to describe the world.

4) Cultural transmission

The ability to communicate in a given language is not instinctual or genetic.  It is transmitted through learning from other speakers of the language.  Children learn to speak a language by listening to those around them.

5) Discreteness

Sounds and words can be clearly distinguished from one another.  So when a person says the word 'cat' they are either understood, or not understood, however the listener never interprets a mispronunciation of the word 'cat' to mean "somewhat catlike".

6) Duality or double articulation

Any stream of speech is made up of several layers of meaningful units: sentences, words. Those meaningful units can then be broken down into meaningless units: letters or phonemes.
