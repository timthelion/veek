### Written language - basic terms

_Grapheme_: What we would normally refer to as a letter.

_Allograph_:  A specific style of writing a grapheme.

_Graph_: A specific instance of an allograph.

#### Writing systems

The [first evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#Southeast_Asia) of drawing appears about 35 000 BCE.

##### Proto-writing

There are several examples of undeciphered proto-scripts, two of them being:

6600 BCE: At an archaeological site in [Jiahu, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu) [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu_symbols) were found with symbols on them.

5300 BCE: At an archaeological site in present day Romania of the [Vinƒça culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture) [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_signs) were found with symbols on them.

##### Earlies deciphered scripts

The first writing systems appeared independently in Egypt (3200 BCE), China (1200 BCE), and South America(600 BCE).

##### Types of writing

Picture based:
 - Mnemonic glyphs act as reminders to a person who already knows the context of what is written.
 - Pictographic glyphs represent concrete things.  A picture of a bird represents a bird.
 - Ideographic glyphs represent abstract ideas. A picture of a bird might represent flight.

Phonetic writing systems:
 - Syllabic: Each symbol represents a whole syllable.
 -Phonetic alphabetic: Each symbol represents a single phoneme.
 - Non-phonetic alphabetic: Each symbol vaguely represents a sound(English).
