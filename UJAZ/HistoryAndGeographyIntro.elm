## History and classification of languages

#### Origin of language

Leading theories about the origin of the many distinct language families:

1) Onomatopoeia

Humans imitating the sounds of nature gradually form a more complex patterns which eventually develop into language.

2) Physiological theory

The evolution of our brains and speech organs leads to the creation of a "speech capability."

3) Tower of Babel theory

God creates language

#### Classification of languages in Europe

Languages are classified into a hierarchy(tree) of families and groups. Wikipedia has a good article on [The distinct language families](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family).

The most studied language family is that of the Indo-European Languages.  It is theorized that the Indo-European Languages all sprang from one [Proto-Indo-European language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) (PIE).  This language has been reconstructed by way of phonetic transformations and comparative linguistic analysis.  The existence of the PIE was first theorised in 1786 by the British judge William Jones while he was working in India.

Most languages in Europe are of the Indo-European family. There are a few notable exceptions:

 - Basque is a language isolate(it does not belong to any of the larger families)

 - Georgian and several sister languages belong to the Kartvelian language family

 - Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian belong to the Uralic language family

 - Turkish and many smaller languages belong to the Turkic family

 - Hebrew and Maltese are Semetic languages

### Cognates

Different languages often have similar words.  When these words are similar because the two languages diverged from one proto-language then we say that the words are **cognates**.

Cognates **ARE**: Two words in two related languages that sound the same and came from the same source word in those two languages proto-language.

Example: The word "hound" in English refers to a hunting dog, whereas in German "Hund" refers to a dog.

Cognates are **NOT**: Borrowings, Unrelated words with similar sound

[Doublets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet**%28linguistics%29) (or possibly **triplets** are cognates within a single language.  For example: frail and fragile both have the same root and similar form and meaning.  Their corresponding Latin root is/was "fragilis".

#### Classifying languages - Overview

Today there are over 30 language families and 5,000 subgroups.  Most languages, 70%, have no written form.  There is no clear way to count the languages.  There is no clear line between dialects and separate languages.

When classifying languages we can look at both extra-linguistic factors and intra-linguistic factors.

- Extra-linguistic factors: Cultural factors
- Intra-linguistic factors: Syntax, phonetics, lexicon

####  History of English

- Old English: 450 - 1066

An off branching of old German with Scandinavian influences

There were three tribes in the British Isles: [Angles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles), [Saxons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons), and [Jutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutes).

In 597 B.C.E. [St. Augustine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury) came to the British Isles.  This marks the start of the written record of the English language.

The nominal end of the Old English period is [the Norman Conquest of 1066](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England) when William the Conqueror came to England.

- Middle English: 1200 - 1500

Addition of French and Latin influences

- Early Modern English: 1500 - 1800

Standardization of English spelling with the invention of the printing press.

- Modern English: 1800 - present
