#### Collective nouns

<img alt="US Flag" width="90%" src="../images/epluribus.png"/>

Back in the dark ages before time began, Britain had 13 colonies in this backwards place called America.  As we all know, having 13 of anything is really bad luck, so those 13 colonies decided to rebel.  In 1782, when the war had almost been won, the newly united states made out of many one.  From that point on, learners of the English language have been frequently confused by a difference in what are  referred to as **collective nouns**.  While the British say "the band **are** playing" and "the team **are** warming up" Americans say "the band **is** playing" and "the team **is** warming up."  Ach jo.

#### Collective nouns

<img alt="A man counting wool" width="90%" src="../images/wool.png"/>

Have you ever tried to count wool?  You pull off little bits of hair clump from the pile and stack it up again on the other side of the room.  But those clumps can be pulled apart too.  After a while you get really confused and start thinking about things like the meaning of life and what exactly one wool is, and how that differs from two wools.  Sure, you can count clumps of wool, or hairs of wool, but wool itself is uncountable.  Since it just seems to pile up in the corner(if you are a wool collector that is) we **ordinarily** refer to it in the singular.  "Some wool **is** piled up in the corner." As opposed to *"some wool **are** piled up in the corner."  There are other forms of **ordinarily singular** nouns as well.  Some names have an 's' at the end that we don't know what to do with.  Athens for example.  We refer to the city in singular, of course, because there's only one of them.  The games of dominoes or darts also fall into this category.  Though their a bit more confusing.  After all, you do play darts with more than one dart, at least up till all the other ones get lost in the bushes.  But since we're talking about the game, and not the objects we use to play it, we refer to it in singular.  "Darts **is** a dangerous game, especially when I'm playing it."

### Ordinarily plural/singular

Somethings, however, are just to plural for us to refer in the singular. Like pants.

Names of games, like darts, are often ordinarily singular.

Examples of the **Ordinarily plural** noun:
 - pants (in Britain trousers)
 - scissors

  Sorry, there's not much rhyme or reason to it.
