## Conjunctions

### Coordinators

Cats **and** dogs **or** dogs **and** cats **but** no one speeks of cats **and** frogs.

### Correlatives

**Either** you're with us **or** you're against us.

You can't be **both** with us **and** against us.

I'm **neither** with you **nor** against you, I'm simply a peice loving hippy high on pot!

### Subordinators

**After** he left he realised that **although** he had taken his keys, **as** he locked the door they had fallen **because** he was so careless.  **Before** he could get them, he found that he needed them *for* the door was locked.
