  ### The perfect present

  Two friends, Bob and Fred, decide to host a surprise party for their third friend George's 23 birthday.  Their out at a bar discussing the plans over a beer or two.  We overhear:

  Fred: "Well, he has been virgin for a long time." (**S**tate present Perfect)
  Bob: "Yeah, and that old blind date thing's been tried at least weekly for the last 6 moths!"(**H**abitual present perfect)

  Fred: "We have been left with but one option."(Event Present perfect)

  Fred and Bob in unison: "The pefect present"

  So anyways.  They got him a prostitute.  Not any cheep one either.  The pefect woman some might say.  Packed her up in a big box with a bow tied on top.  George was done so quick, he never quite picked up her name.  So all Fred and Bob heard about for the next moth was "SHE, SHE, SHE".

  "**She** was perverse!" He would say.  "**She** coulda made AJ cry." He would say.  To which Bob would politely respond "who couldn't?" without looking up from his computer screen.

  So here "she" is.  At least, that's the best I could do.  Of course, I suppose the **perfect** woman would at least have arms.  But who knows, maybe George likes cripples.
