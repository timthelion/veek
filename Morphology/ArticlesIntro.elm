#### Generic reference

  The chair is the downfall of western civilization.  Well, if it's not, it will be.  Makes your back ache and after a while sitting in it you die of a heart attack.  "The chair" in this case, is a **generic reference**.  We aren't referring to any one chair in particular, though it would be awesome if that giant chair in Prague came to life and started tearing things apart.

  The **generic reference** is relatively free in form.  We can also say that "chairs are the downfall of western civilization."  Even more free in form is the generic reference where the subject compliment is a prototype of a category.  "The chair is a piece of furniture." "A chair is a piece of furniture." and "Chairs are furniture." all mean the same thing.

#### Non-generic reference definite

  The cat(**S**ituational non-generic reference - definite) is on a beach.  There is sand on the beach(**An**aphoric **D**irect non-generic reference - definite). The waves(anaphoric **in**direct non-generic reference - definite) are crashing down all around. The is eating sand.  The sand is in the stomach(**cat**aphoric non-generic reference - definite) of the cat.  Cats are crazy.

#### Non-generic reference indefinite

  A man(Non-generic **sp**ecific **i**ndefinite reference) is spinning, he is trying very hard. He wants to attract a woman(**n**on-specific non-generic indefinite reference), but none fall for such a ploy.
