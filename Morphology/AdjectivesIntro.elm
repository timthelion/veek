I turned the corner, and saw an old(**A**ttributive only adjective) and rusty door.  Vibrating.  I felt afraid(**P**redicative only adjective).  I opened the door to see an intense rap battle going on.

  "Hey, when I was down in the hood I gone and saw some measly(**D**owntoner) kid buyin candy.  Was that you? Hu? Were you that kid?"

  "Hey, if you was a real(**E**mphasizer) man maybe you'da gone and found out. Hu? Were were you? Hu? Peepin from the oak tree?"

  "Hey, you was a complete(**A**mplifier a**D**jective) mess.  I was afraid I'd get AIDs if I came too close." 

  I closed the door and turned away.  Hoping I'd get outta there before one of them rappers was DEAD.
