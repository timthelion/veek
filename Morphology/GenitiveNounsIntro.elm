### Grammatical status of genitive

Determiner x Modifier

#### Genitive meanings



Perhaps it was a result of John's overeating(**S**ubjective genitive) or perhaps it was because of the meal's spiciness(genitive of **A**ttribute).  We may never know.  But John could not sit in that dinner's hall(**D**escriptive genitive) any longer.  He rushed to the restroom and found the first stall.  John's watch(**P**ossessive genitive) scratched against the door as he tried to turn the handle.  The door was locked. John went to the next stall and felt relief at the door's opening(**O**bjective genitive). He did not take note of the lengthly poet's verse(genitive of **O**rigin) written upon the walls.  He took his dump.  He looked down. The poop's peek(**P**artative genitive) was drooping and soft. "SAD POOP" he thought.  Then he got up and returned to his dinner.
